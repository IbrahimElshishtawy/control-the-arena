# LAB-01: Collapsed Facility
# -------------------------
LAB_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Ryn: ...Where am I? What happened to this place?",
    "Lira: You finally woke up. This facility collapsed after the Core explosion.",
    "Ryn: Who are you?",
    "Lira: Name's Lira. Engineer... and probably your only ally if you want to get out of here.",
    "Ryn: I feel like I've been here before...",
    "Lira: You have. You were part of the Core Protection Team before everything went dark. Your memory is fragmented.",
]

LAB_ECHO_1_DIALOGUE = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Child's voice): Get back! The Core is going to blow any second!",
    "[Memory Echo] (Commanding voice): Initiate emergency protocol. No hesitation!",
    "Ryn: These voices... I was here, in this facility, right before the explosion.",
    "Lira: I'll decode what you just saw. It might lead us to whoever triggered the first collapse.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 2: Ashfall City – First Arrival
# -------------------------
CITY_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: You're out of the lab. Welcome to Ashfall City... or what's left of it.",
    "Ryn: This place looks like it’s been hit by more than just an explosion.",
    "Lira: Gangs, failed evacuations, energy storms. The Core’s shockwave broke more than buildings.",
    "Ryn: You said someone triggered the collapse on purpose.",
    "Lira: The Ascendants. Their leader, Seraph, believes the Core should be used to rewrite reality.",
    "Ryn: Rewrite reality… and I’m somehow connected to that?",
    "Lira: More than you know. Our Keepers contact is somewhere in this sector. Find him, and maybe we find the truth.",
]

CITY_STREET_ECHO_1 = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Child): Dad, you promised you wouldn't go back to the Core!",
    "[Memory Echo] (Man): I have to. If we do nothing, they’ll turn it into a weapon.",
    "Ryn: That man... he’s wearing my old unit tag.",
    "Lira: Tag reads 'Dr. Rowan Carter'. Either that’s family... or a past you never remembered.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 3: Rift Zone – Fractured Reality
# -------------------------
RIFT_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: You're entering the Rift Zone now. This is where the Core's shockwave tore reality open.",
    "Ryn: Feels wrong just standing here. The air… it echoes.",
    "Lira: Echoes here won't just show you the past. They might show you what could have happened.",
    "Ryn: Alternate outcomes.",
    "Lira: Exactly. Be careful. The more you question what’s real, the more the Core will try to stabilize a different branch.",
]

RIFT_ALT_PATH_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Alt Ryn): We never left the lab. We sealed the Core and locked everyone out.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Alt Lira): In that branch, Ashfall City never fell… but the Ascendants took everything else.",
    "Ryn: This isn't just memory. It's a different version of me making a different choice.",
    "Lira: The Core recorded multiple branches of you. It’s choosing which ones to show you for a reason.",
]

RIFT_REVEAL_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): Once we split your identity stream, one version of you stays inside the simulation.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): The other wakes up in the 'real' world. The Echoes will keep them in sync.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Lira): As long as the Core stays stable… we can still decide which Ryn the world remembers.",
    "Ryn: So I'm not just remembering the past. I'm competing with other versions of myself.",
    "Lira: And only one of you gets to decide what the final reality looks like.",
]
# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 4: Keepers Hidden Facility
# -------------------------
KEEPERS_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: This is it. One of the last hidden facilities the Keepers still control.",
    "Ryn: Doesn't look like much from the outside.",
    "Lira: That's the point. After the Core collapse, anything obvious was wiped or taken.",
    "Ryn: You said your contact was here.",
    "Lira: Commander Hale. He knows more about the Core project and about you than anyone else still alive.",
    "Ryn: That supposed to make me feel better?",
    "Lira: Depends on how much truth you’re ready to handle.",
]

KEEPERS_MEETING_DIALOGUE = [
    "Hale: So… the famous Ryn Carter finally walks into my facility.",
    "Ryn: We've met before?",
    "Hale: Many times. The issue is: only one of you remembers those meetings.",
    "Ryn: One of me?",
    "Hale: The Core didn't just copy timelines, it copied you. Fragments of you have been working against each other for months.",
    "Lira: Hale, we don't have time for philosophy. We need a plan before Seraph reaches the backup Core.",
    "Hale: Then the plan starts here: Ryn needs to choose which version of himself this reality will listen to.",
]

KEEPERS_SECRET_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Past Lira): If this works, he won't remember me like this.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Hale): But you'll remember every branch he walks through. That’s a heavy burden.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Past Lira): Someone has to carry the real timeline. Let him believe he's just trying to fix a broken world.",
    "Ryn: So you were guiding me… but not telling me everything.",
    "Lira: I was trying to give you a choice without breaking you first.",
]
# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 5: Ascendant Spire
# -------------------------
ASCENDANT_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: That's the Ascendant Spire. Seraph's people turned it into a vertical fortress.",
    "Ryn: Whole tower pulsing with Core energy. This can't be stable.",
    "Lira: It isn't. They're running out of time just like we are.",
    "Ryn: So why climb into a collapsing tower?",
    "Lira: Because the backup Core interface is at the top. If Seraph reaches it first, he writes the ending.",
]

ASCENDANT_SERAPH_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): You still think there was ever one real version of you, Ryn?",
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): The Core copied you into so many branches, you stopped being a person and became a pattern.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Alt Ryn): If I'm just a pattern… then I can still choose what I repeat.",
    "Ryn: That other me… he sounds more sure than I am.",
    "Lira: Or more desperate. Both can be dangerous.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 6: Core Chamber – Final Convergence
# -------------------------
CORE_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: This is it. The backup Core interface.",
    "Ryn: Feels… louder than the one in my memories.",
    "Lira: It's not just storing branches anymore. It's trying to resolve them.",
    "Ryn: Resolve… as in erase everything that doesn't fit?",
    "Lira: Unless someone tells it what 'final' is supposed to look like.",
]

CORE_FINAL_CHOICE_INTRO = [
    "Seraph: You made it further than most of your other selves.",
    "Ryn: Other selves?",
    "Seraph: Some versions of you joined me. Others tried to kill me. A few never made it out of the lab.",
    "Lira: This is the one that did.",
    "Seraph: For now. The Core is listening, Ryn. It will shape reality around the branch you choose.",
]

CORE_FINAL_CHOICE_ENDING_RESET = [
    "Ryn: Then we cut everything back to the last stable point.",
    "Lira: You'd erase Ashfall, the Rift, all of this… including us.",
    "Ryn: Better one honest timeline than a thousand broken ones.",
    "Seraph: So be it. The world will never know how many times it tried to end.",
    "[System]: CORE DECISION LOCKED – COLLAPSE OF BRANCHES IN PROGRESS.",
]

CORE_FINAL_CHOICE_ENDING_PRESERVE = [
    "Ryn: No. We keep this branch. Messy, broken, but real.",
    "Seraph: You'll live in a world built on fragments.",
    "Ryn: Every world is. At least here, people get to keep what they fought for.",
    "Lira: Then we stabilize this reality… and live with what it remembers.",
    "[System]: CORE DECISION LOCKED – STABILIZING CURRENT BRANCH.",
]
# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 7: Ruined Archive – Data Grave
# -------------------------
ARCHIVE_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: This… isn’t a physical place anymore.",
    "Ryn: Feels like I’m walking inside a corrupted backup.",
    "Lira: The Ruined Archive. Every failed branch, every aborted timeline, dumped in one digital graveyard.",
    "Ryn: All of this… are versions of the world that never made it?",
    "Lira: Or versions that weren’t allowed to. Keep your guard up – some of them are still trying to resolve.",
]

ARCHIVE_LOG_ECHO_1 = [
    "[System Log]: BRANCH-017A marked as 'UNSTABLE'. Cause: Subject R.Carter refused Core access.",
    "[System Log]: BRANCH-021C marked as 'TERMINATED'. Cause: L.Kade disabled identity fork mid-process.",
    "Ryn: They catalogued our choices like error codes.",
    "Lira: And deleted entire worlds when they didn’t fit their projection.",
]

ARCHIVE_HIDDEN_ECHO = [
    "[Hidden Echo] (Unknown voice): You are not the first Ryn to find this place.",
    "[Hidden Echo]: But you might be the first who refuses to walk away from it.",
    "Ryn: Who are you?",
    "[Hidden Echo]: Call me what the Keepers called me – a glitch. Or what Seraph called me – a warning.",
    "Lira: Ryn… whatever that is, it’s been here longer than any of us.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 8: Mirror Walk – Parallel Self
# -------------------------
MIRROR_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Ryn: Walls made of reflections. Of me.",
    "Lira: This is a Mirror Walk. The Core folds your branches in on themselves.",
    "Ryn: Every step I take, I see a version of me who took a different one.",
    "Lira: Somewhere in here is the branch that tried to replace you.",
    "Ryn: The ‘other me’ Seraph kept talking about.",
]

MIRROR_DUEL_ECHO = [
    "[Mirror Ryn]: You think you’re the original because you’re the one still moving.",
    "Ryn: I’m the one still fighting.",
    "[Mirror Ryn]: No. You’re the one still asking if this is real. That’s your weakness… and your strength.",
    "Lira: If you sync with him, you might gain what he knows… or lose what you are.",
]

MIRROR_RESOLUTION_DIALOGUE = [
    "Ryn: I’m done competing with ghosts of myself.",
    "Mirror Ryn: Then take what you need and let the rest of me go.",
    "[System]: BRANCH ALIGNMENT – PARTIAL MERGE COMPLETE.",
    "Lira: Your signal just got stronger across all branches.",
    "Ryn: Good. Then let the Core hear this version clearly.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 9: Silent Orbit – Above the Cradle
# -------------------------
ORBIT_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: Welcome to the Silent Orbit. First Core prototypes were tested here, before the city ever knew.",
    "Ryn: No fires. No ruins. Just… quiet.",
    "Lira: That’s what’s left when you erase history cleanly.",
    "Ryn: You’re saying this place was wiped from every branch?",
    "Lira: Almost. The fact that we can stand here means some part of it refused to disappear.",
]

ORBIT_REVELATION_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Old Scientist): This isn’t the first reboot cycle.",
    "[Memory Echo]: We’ve reset the world three times. Each time, more people remember fragments they were supposed to forget.",
    "[Memory Echo]: Eventually, someone like him was going to notice.",
    "Ryn: ‘Him’… they were talking about me?",
    "Lira: About whoever carried your pattern. You were never just one person to the Core.",
]

ORBIT_LIRA_CONFRONT_DIALOGUE = [
    "Ryn: How long have you known all of this, Lira?",
    "Lira: Long enough to be afraid of telling you.",
    "Ryn: And you still dragged me through every broken branch anyway.",
    "Lira: Because if any version of you could walk all the way to the end… it was the one that kept asking questions.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 10: Origin Core – First Signal
# -------------------------
ORIGIN_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: This is where it started. Before the weapons, before the factions… just the Origin Core.",
    "Ryn: Smaller than I imagined.",
    "Lira: Back then it was just a way to store possibilities, not overwrite them.",
    "Ryn: Somewhere between this and what we saw in the Chamber… someone decided ‘storing’ wasn’t enough.",
]

ORIGIN_CHOICE_SETUP = [
    "Ryn: If I walk away, what happens?",
    "Lira: The Core keeps listening to every human signal it can find and keeps folding reality around them.",
    "Ryn: And if I shut it down completely?",
    "Lira: No more branches. No more reboots. No more second chances.",
    "Ryn: There has to be something between blind chaos and absolute control.",
]

ORIGIN_EPILOGUE_OPEN_END = [
    "Ryn: Then we teach it one simple rule.",
    "Lira: Just one?",
    "Ryn: No branch is allowed to erase another branch entirely.",
    "Lira: So every choice leaves a trace.",
    "Ryn: Enough that someone, somewhere, can remember we were here.",
    "[System]: ORIGIN DIRECTIVE ACCEPTED – FUTURE BRANCHES WILL RETAIN ECHOES OF PRIOR STATES.",
]

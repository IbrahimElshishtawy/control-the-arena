# LAB-01: Collapsed Facility
# -------------------------
LAB_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Ryn: ...Where am I? What happened to this place?",
    "Lira: You finally woke up. This facility collapsed after the Core explosion.",
    "Ryn: Who are you?",
    "Lira: Name's Lira. Engineer... and probably your only ally if you want to get out of here.",
    "Ryn: I feel like I've been here before...",
    "Lira: You have. You were part of the Core Protection Team before everything went dark. Your memory is fragmented.",
]

LAB_ECHO_1_DIALOGUE = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Child's voice): Get back! The Core is going to blow any second!",
    "[Memory Echo] (Commanding voice): Initiate emergency protocol. No hesitation!",
    "Ryn: These voices... I was here, in this facility, right before the explosion.",
    "Lira: I'll decode what you just saw. It might lead us to whoever triggered the first collapse.",
]

# CHAPTER 2: Ashfall City – First Arrival
# -------------------------
CITY_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: You're out of the lab. Welcome to Ashfall City... or what's left of it.",
    "Ryn: This place looks like it’s been hit by more than just an explosion.",
    "Lira: Gangs, failed evacuations, energy storms. The Core’s shockwave broke more than buildings.",
    "Ryn: You said someone triggered the collapse on purpose.",
    "Lira: The Ascendants. Their leader, Seraph, believes the Core should be used to rewrite reality.",
    "Ryn: Rewrite reality… and I’m somehow connected to that?",
    "Lira: More than you know. Our Keepers contact is somewhere in this sector. Find him, and maybe we find the truth.",
]

CITY_STREET_ECHO_1 = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Child): Dad, you promised you wouldn't go back to the Core!",
    "[Memory Echo] (Man): I have to. If we do nothing, they’ll turn it into a weapon.",
    "Ryn: That man... he’s wearing my old unit tag.",
    "Lira: Tag reads 'Dr. Rowan Carter'. Either that’s family... or a past you never remembered.",
]

# -------------------------
# CHAPTER 3: Rift Zone – Fractured Reality
# -------------------------
RIFT_INTRO_DIALOGUE = [
    "Lira: You're entering the Rift Zone now. This is where the Core's shockwave tore reality open.",
    "Ryn: Feels wrong just standing here. The air… it echoes.",
    "Lira: Echoes here won't just show you the past. They might show you what could have happened.",
    "Ryn: Alternate outcomes.",
    "Lira: Exactly. Be careful. The more you question what’s real, the more the Core will try to stabilize a different branch.",
]

RIFT_ALT_PATH_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Alt Ryn): We never left the lab. We sealed the Core and locked everyone out.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Alt Lira): In that branch, Ashfall City never fell… but the Ascendants took everything else.",
    "Ryn: This isn't just memory. It's a different version of me making a different choice.",
    "Lira: The Core recorded multiple branches of you. It’s choosing which ones to show you for a reason.",
]

RIFT_REVEAL_ECHO = [
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): Once we split your identity stream, one version of you stays inside the simulation.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Seraph): The other wakes up in the 'real' world. The Echoes will keep them in sync.",
    "[Memory Echo] (Lira): As long as the Core stays stable… we can still decide which Ryn the world remembers.",
    "Ryn: So I'm not just remembering the past. I'm competing with other versions of myself.",
    "Lira: And only one of you gets to decide what the final reality looks like.",
]
